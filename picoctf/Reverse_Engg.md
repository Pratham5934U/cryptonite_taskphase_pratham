**Thought Process**   
First after knowing that in this challenge I had to use java, I recalled my prexisting knowledge of java and on reading the whole program I realised that it 
basically wants the correct password which could be easily seen in the program itself but the thing was that whatsoever I input it gets manipulated by some
`for` loops. So I created another by copying the `for` loops but in this program i reversed the input and the final `string` which I got was the the content
of the flag.

**OUTPUT**
