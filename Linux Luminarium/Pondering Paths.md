# 1. The Root

**Flag:**  
pwn.college{YskNYpLaAzmi1p5BR-CEiHXKBHF.dhzN5QDLzcTN0czW}

**Procedure:**   
In Linux filesystem to refer any files we need to provide exact path i.e. location of the file and the path start with "/" and in order to descend further into the files we 
need to use "/" symbol again after typing the exact and the correct path we press enter. In the challenge 'The Root' a program was already added in / nammed as pwn so I had to just 
type the absolute path of the program pwn in the terminal to get the flag. The absolute path was /pwn .
